We show that end-to-end Deep Learning can replace traditional feature engineering in the signal processing domain.
Not only does a combination of convolutional layers and LSTMs perform better for the task of emotion recognition, we also demonstrate that some cells’ activations in the convolutional network are highly correlated with hand-crafted features.
